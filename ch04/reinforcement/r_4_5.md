# Exercise R-4.5

## Problem

Draw the recursion trace for the execution of function `PuzzleSolve(3, S, U)`
(Code Fragment 4.14), where `S` is empty and `U = {a, b, c, d}`.

```
Algorithm PuzzleSolve(k, S, U):
    Input: An integer k, sequence S, and set U
    Output: An enumeration of all k-length extensions to S using elements in U
        without repetitions.

    for each e in U do
        Add e to the end of S
        Remove e from U
        if k == 1 then
            Test whether S is a configuration that solves the puzzle
            If S solves the puzzle then
                return "Solution found: " S
        else
            PuzzleSolve(k - 1, S, U)
        Remove e from the end of S
        Add e back to U
```

## Answer

```
PuzzleSolve(3, [], {a, b, c, d})
    PuzzleSolve(2, [a], {b, c, d})
        PuzzleSolve(1, [a, b], {c, d}) -> abc, abd
        PuzzleSolve(1, [a, c], {b, d}) -> acb, acd
        PuzzleSolve(1, [a, d], {b, c}) -> adb, adc

    PuzzleSolve(2, [b], {c, d, a})
        PuzzleSolve(1, [b, c], {d, a}) -> bcd, bca
        PuzzleSolve(1, [b, d], {c, a}) -> bdc, bda
        PuzzleSolve(1, [b, a], {c, d}) -> bac, bad

    PuzzleSolve(2, [c], {d, a, b})
        PuzzleSolve(1, [c, d], {a, b}) -> cda, cdb
        PuzzleSolve(1, [c, a], {d, b}) -> cad, cab
        PuzzleSolve(1, [c, b], {d, a}) -> cbd, cba

    PuzzleSolve(2, [d], {a, b, c})
        PuzzleSolve(1, [d, a], {b, c}) -> dab, dac
        PuzzleSolve(1, [d, b], {a, c}) -> dba, dbc
        PuzzleSolve(1, [d, c], {a, b}) -> dca, dcb
