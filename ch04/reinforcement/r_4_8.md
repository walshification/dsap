# Exercise R-4.8

## Problem

Isabel has an interesting way of summing up the values in a sequence _A_ of _n_
integers, where _n_ is a power of two. She creates a new sequence _B_ of half
the size of _A_ and sets _B_\[_i_\] = _A_\[2_i_\], for _i_ = 0, 1, ..., (_n_/2)
\- 1. If _B_ has size 1, then she outputs _B_\[0\]. Otherwise, she replaces _A_
with _B_, and repeats the process.

What is the running time of her algorithm?

```
Algorithm IsabelSum(A):
    Input: A sequence A
    Output: An integer k that is the summation of the sequence.

    if len(B) == 1:
        return B[0]

    B = []
    for each index in len(A)/2 - 1 do
        B[index] = A[2*index] + A[2*index + 1]

    return IsabelSum(B)
```

## Answer

The running time is O(log(n)), I think.
