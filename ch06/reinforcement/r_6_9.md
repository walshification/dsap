# Exercise R-6.9

## Problem

Had the queue of the previous problem been an instance of ArrayQueue
that used an initial array of capacity 30, and had its size never been greater
than 30, what would be the final value of the front instance variable?

## Answer

Assuming the capacity does not change, the initial _front is 0 and increments
with each dequeue operation that does not raise an error. Therefore, _front is the number of non-error dequeue operations modulo the capacity of the internal array.

In other words: 10.
