# Exercise R-1.8

## Question

Python allows negative integers to be used as indices into a sequence,
such as a string. If string s has length n, and expression s[k] is used
for index -n <= k < 0, what is the equivalent index j >= 0 such that
s[j] references the same element?

## Answer

for string `s` of length `n` and index `k` such that `-n <= k < 0`,
index `j` such that `j >= 0` is equivalent to `n + k`.

```python
In [1]: s = "string"

In [2]: n = len(s)

In [3]: k_list = [k for k in range(-n, 0)]  # -n <= k < 0

In [4]: # check s[k] against s[j] where j is n + k

In [5]: all(s[k] == s[n + k] for k in k_list)
Out[5]: True
```
