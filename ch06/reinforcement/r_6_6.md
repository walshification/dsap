# Exercise R-6.6

## Problem

Give a precise and complete definition of the concept of matching for grouping
symbols in an arithmetic expression. Your definition may be recursive.

## Answer

```
Algorithm DoesMatch(expression, open_delimiters, close_delimiters, S):
  Input: An arithmetic expression, a collection of open delimiters indicating
    the start of a group, a collection of close delimiters indicating the end
    of a group, an empty stack S for delimiters as they are found.
  Output: True if the expression matches its group-delineated symbols.


  character = expression[0]
  if character in open_delimiters do
    S.push(character)

  elif character in close_delimiters do
    return False if S is empty

    open = S.pop()
    if open does not match character do
      return False

  return DoesMatch(expression[index:], open_delimiters, close_delimiters, S)
```
