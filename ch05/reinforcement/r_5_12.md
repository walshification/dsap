# Exercise R-5.12

## Problem

Describe how the built-in sum function can be combined with Python's
comprehension syntax to compute the sum of all numbers in an _n_ x _n_ data
set, represented as a list of lists.

## Answer

```python
In [1]: def create_matrix(n):
   ...:     return [
   ...:         [k + l for l in range(n)]
   ...:         for k in range(n)
   ...:     ]
   ...:

In [2]: three_by_three = create_matrix(3)

In [3]: three_by_three
Out[3]: [
            [0, 1, 2],
            [1, 2, 3],
            [2, 3, 4]
        ]

In [4]: def compute_sums(matrix):
   ...:     return sum(sum(k for k in _list) for _list in matrix)

In [5]: compute_sums(three_by_three)
Out[5]: 18

In [6]: compute_sums(create_matrix(10))
Out[6]: 900
```
