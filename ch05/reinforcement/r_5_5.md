# Exercise R-5.5

## Problem

Redo the justification of Proposition 5.1 assuming that the cost of growing the
array from size _k_ to size _2k_ is _3k_ cyber-dollars. How much should each
append operation be charged to make the amortization work?

## Answer

Growing an array of size _k_ to _2k_ at _k_ cost costs 3 cyber-dollars to bank
the requisite cyber-dollars:

```
            2 +2 +2 +2
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
```
doubling:
```
                        2
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, _, _, _, _, _, _, _
```

If doubling an array costs _3k_ cyber-dollars:

```
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (8 entries) = 24
```
then each append must bank **6 cyber-dollars**:
```
            4 +4 +6 +6
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
```
becoming:
```
                        6
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, _, _, _, _, _, _, _
```

The pattern hold for the next doubling:
```
                        6  6   6   6   6   6   6   6
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 (16 entries) = 48
```
                                                       6
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _, _
```
