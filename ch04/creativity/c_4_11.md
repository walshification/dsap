# Exercise C-4.11

## Problem

Describe an efficient recursive function for solving the element uniqueness
problem, which runs in time that is at most O(n2) in the worst case without
using sorting.

## Answer

```
Algorithm UniqueSequence(S, i):
  Input: A sequence S and an optional index i (default 0).
  Output: A boolean whether or not the elements are unique.

  if len(S) == j do
    return True

  for index in the range from i + 1 to the length of S do
    if S[i] == S[index]:
      return False

  return UniqueSequence(S, i + 1)
```
