# Exercise R-6.8

## Problem

Suppose an initially empty queue Q has executed a total of 32 enqueue
operations, 10 first operations, and 15 dequeue operations, 5 of which
raised Empty errors that were caught and ignored. What is the current
size of Q?

## Answer

32 enqueue operations increase the size to 32.
10 first operations do not affect the size.
5 dequeue operations raise Empty and therefore do not affect the size.
10 remaining pop operations decrease the size by 10.

32 - 10 = 22
