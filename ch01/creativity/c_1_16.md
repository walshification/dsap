# Exercise C-1.16

## Question

In our implementation of the `scale` function (page 25), the body of the loop
executes the command `data[j] *= factor`. We have discussed that numeric
types are immutable, and that use of the `*=` operator in this context causes
the creation of a new instance (not the mutation of an existing instance).
How is it still possible, then, that out implementation of `scale` changes the
actual parameter sent by the caller?

## Answer

```python
def scale(data, factor):
    for j in range(len(data)):
        data[j] *= factor
```

This implementation works because the underlying data type of `data` is
mutable, so the value residing at `data[j]` is able to be reassigned to point
to a new valueâ€”that of `data[j] * factor`. `data` exists outside the function
and therefore does not need to be returned in order to persist.

```python
>>> data = [2, 3, 4, 5]

>>> scale(data, 2)

>>> data
[4, 6, 8, 10]
```
