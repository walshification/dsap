# Exercise C-1.17

## Question

Had we implemented the `scale` function (page 25) as follows, does it work
properly?

```python
def scale(data, factor):
    for val in data:
        val *= factor
```

## Answer

No. One expects the values within the iterable `data` to be changed; however,
once we are within the scope of the function `scale`, the values within `data`
locally scoped to the function. Changing their references does not persist back
to the underlying iterable outside the scope of the function. We would need to
return the new values and assign them to the same reference for that to be the
case.

```python
>>> data = [2, 3, 4, 5]

>>> scale(data, 2)

>>> data
[2, 3, 4, 5]
```
