# Exercise R-6.7

## Problem

What values are returned during the following sequence of queue operations, if
executed on an initially empty queue? enqueue(5), enqueue(3), dequeue(),
enqueue(2), enqueue(8), dequeue(), dequeue(), enqueue(9), enqueue(1),
dequeue(), enqueue(7), enqueue(6), dequeue(), dequeue(), enqueue(4), dequeue(),
dequeue().

## Answer

Command | State | Return Value
---|---|---
enqueue(5) | [5, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None] | None
enqueue(3) | [5, 3, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None] | None
dequeue() | [None, 3, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None] | 5
enqueue(2) | [None, 3, 2, None, None, None, None, None, None, None] | None
enqueue(8) | [None, 3, 2, 8, None, None, None, None, None, None] | None
dequeue() | [None, None, 2, 8, None, None, None, None, None, None] | 3
dequeue() | [None, None, None, 8, None, None, None, None, None, None] | 2
enqueue(9) | [None, None, None, 8, 9, None, None, None, None, None] | None
enqueue(1) | [None, None, None, 8, 9, 1, None, None, None, None] | None
dequeue() | [None, None, None, None, 9, 1, None, None, None, None] | 8
enqueue(7) | [None, None, None, None, 9, 1, 7, None, None, None] | None
enqueue(6) | [None, None, None, None, 9, 1, 7, 6, None, None] | None
dequeue() | [None, None, None, None, None, 1, 7, 6, None, None] | 9
dequeue() | [None, None, None, None, None, None, 7, 6, None, None] | 1
enqueue(4) | [None, None, None, None, None, None, 7, 6, 4, None] | None
dequeue() | [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 6, 4, None] | 7
dequeue() | [None, None, None, None, None, None, None, None, 4, None] | 6
