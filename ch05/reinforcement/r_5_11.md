# Exercise R-5.11

## Problem

Us standard control structures to compute the sum of all numbers in an _n_ x
_n_ data set, represented as a list of lists.

## Answer

```python
In [1]: def create_matrix(n):
   ...:     return [
   ...:         [k + l for l in range(n)]
   ...:         for k in range(n)
   ...:     ]
   ...:

In [2]: three_by_three = create_matrix(3)

In [3]: three_by_three
Out[3]: [[0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]]

In [4]: def compute_sums(matrix):
   ...:     total = 0
   ...:     for _list in matrix:
   ...:         for k in _list:
   ...:             total += k
   ...:     return total
   ...:

In [5]: compute_sums(three_by_three)
Out[5]: 18

In [6]: compute_sums(create_matrix(10))
Out[6]: 900
```
