# Exercise R-1.8

## Question

Python allows negative integers to be used as indices into a sequence,
such as a string. If string s has length n, and expression s[k] is used
for index -n <= k < 0, what is the equivalent index j >= 0 such that
s[j] references the same element?

## Answer

for string `s` of length `n` and index `k` such that `-n <= k < 0`,
index `j` such that `j >= 0` is equivalent to `n + k`.

```python
>>> s = "string"

>>> n = len(s)

>>> # -n <= k < 0
>>> k_list = [k for k in range(-n, 0)]

>>> # check s[k] against s[j] where j is n + k
>>> all(s[k] == s[n + k] for k in k_list)
True
```
