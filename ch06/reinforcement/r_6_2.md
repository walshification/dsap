# Exercise R-6.2

## Problem

Suppose an initially empty stack S has executed a total of 25 push operations,
12 top operations, and 10 pop operations, 3 of which raised Empty errors that
were caught and ignored. What is the current size of S?

## Answer

25 push operations increase the size to 25.
12 top operations do not affect the size.
3 pop operations raise Empty and therefore do not affect the size.
7 remaining pop operations decrease the size by 7.

25 - 7 = 18
