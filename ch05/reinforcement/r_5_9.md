# Exercise R-5.9

## Problem

Explain the changes that would have to be made to the program of Code Fragment
5.11 so that it could perform the Caesar cipher for messages that are written
in an alphabet-based language other than English, such as Greek, Russian, or
Hebrew.

## Answer

The \_\_init\_\_ would need to be changed to allow for an optional alphabet
name. That name could be used in a dictionary that held the value for the first
letter in the given alphabet; thus, setting the proper offset for the encoder
and decoder. We would also need to store configuration for the correct lengths
of each alphabet, so we know how many characters to store and what the modulo
needs to wrap characters.
