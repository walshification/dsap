# Exercise R-6.10

## Problem

Consider what happens if the loop in the ArrayQueue. resize method at
lines 53â€“55 of Code Fragment 6.7 had been implemented as:

```python
for k in range(self. size):
    self. data[k] = old[k]  # rather than old[walk]
```

Give a clear explanation of what could go wrong.

## Answer

Given this implementation, the queue would quickly lose its order as copied
values were initially enqueued in recently dequeued positions jump the line, as
it were.

```python
In [1]: q = ArrayQueue()

In [2]: for i in range(10):  # the default capacity
   ...:     q.enqueue(i)
   ...:

In [3]: q.dequeue()
Out[3]: 0

In [4]: q.dequeue()
Out[4]: 1

In [5]: q.dequeue()
Out[5]: 2

In [6]: for i in range(10, 20):  # more than the default capacity
   ...:     q.enqueue(i)
   ...:

In [7]: q._data
Out[7]: [10, 11, 12, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, None, None, None]

In [8]: q.dequeue()  # should be 3
Out[8]: 10
```
