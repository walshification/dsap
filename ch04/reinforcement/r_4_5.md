# Exercise R-4.5

## Problem

Draw the recursion trace for the execution of function `PuzzleSolve(3, S, U)`
(Code Fragment 4.14), where `S` is empty and `U = {a, b, c, d}`.

```python
def reverse(S, start, stop):
    if start < stop - 1:
        S[start], S[stop - 1] = S[stop - 1], S[start]
        reverse(S, start + 1, stop - 1)
```

## Answer

```
reverse([4, 3, 6, 2, 6], 0, 5)
 |
  ` reverse([6, 3, 6, 2, 4], 1, 4)
     |
      ` reverse([6, 2, 6, 3, 4], 2, 3)
```
