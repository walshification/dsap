# Exercise C-4.14

## Problem

In the _Towers of Hanoi_ puzzle, we are given a platform with three pegs,
_a_, _b_, and _c_, sticking out of it. On peg _a_ is a stack of _n_
disks, each larger than the next, so that the smallest is on the top and
the largest is on the bottom.

The puzzle is to move all the disks from peg _a_ to peg _c_, moving one
disk at a time, so that we never place a larger disk on top of a smaller
one.

Describe a recursive algorithm for solving the _Towers of Hanoi_ puzzle
for arbitrary _n_. (Hint: Consider first the subproblem of moving all
but the nth disk from peg _a_ to another peg using the third as
"temporary storage.")

## Answer

```
Algorithm TowersOfHanoi(n, a, b, c):
  Input: A number of plates n of decreasing size from the bottom, a seqence
    that holds the plates, an empty sequence b as a spare tower, and an empty
    sequence c as the destination.
  Output: Empty sequences a and b and sequence c containing n integers of
    decreasing size.

  if len(a) == 0 do
    return a, b, c

  # Recursively move all but the last plate to the spare tower.
  TowersOfHanoi(n - 1, a, c, b)

  Move the bottom disk from a to the destination c.

  # Recursively complete the puzzle.
  TowersofHanoi(n - 1, b, a, c)
